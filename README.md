# origami
origami is a lightweight, modular game engine built on top of SDL3.

# Project Goals
* Superior developer experience
* Fast build times
* Thoroughly documented
* High test coverage

# Note
I originally strated this project by following Gustavo Pezzi's [C++ Game Engine Programming course](https://pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development) on Pikuma. I highly recommend checking it out if you want to learn more about game engine development.
